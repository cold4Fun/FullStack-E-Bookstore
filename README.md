# FullStack-E-Bookstore

This is a full stack E bookstore created for better user experiences.

How to run:

Step 1

npm install -g vue-cli
This command will install vue-cli globally. Think of it like buying a tool, which you purchase once(free in our case) and can use it any number of times. So for setting up another project from next time, this command is not required. So number of steps for setting up any new project is actually 4!

Step 2

Syntax: vue init <template-name> <project-name>
example: vue init webpack-simple new-project

You can choose from various templates(simple, webpack, pwa etc.) from here.


Step 3

cd new-project
Change directory to your project folder

Step 4

npm install
Install all the dependencies required by the template as listed in package.json file. This step may take a minute or two to get all the dependencies.

Step 5

npm run dev
This command will start your local http server, open the browser and your default hosted web page will be shown.
